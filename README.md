# Notebooks

In this repository, you'll find two notebooks. One (yahoo.ipynb) holds our summary generation analysis on the Yahoo Annoted Comment Corpus dataset. The other (wikipedia-final.ipynb) holds our sumamary generation analysis on the Wikipedia Abusive Conversations Corpus dataset. 

You may run the notebooks after downloading the datasets below and placing them in the appropriate 'data' directory on your local machine. Please note that training the models may take several hours, as the size of the corpus is large (>1GB).
